TODO: 
- create modal windows + mechanic:
    - player won
    - player lost
    - menu will player click ESC: 
        * save progress
        * save progress and back to main menu
        * back to main menu without saving
        * settings
- save progress (score and hp)
- main menu js (buttons handlers)
- redo prototypes
- change sound button ( don't like it :| )

finally:
- make the scene and all windows created through JS
- monsters death animation (mb change gif)
- clean code (especially css)



maybe:
? storytelling ?
? change Observer to clean the scene / super attack ?
